jsLDAViewer
===========

An alternative viewer for jsLDA, a native javascript implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm
written by David Mimno (https://github.com/mimno/jsLDA). LDA is a popular Topic Modeling algorithm which can find topics 
in a text corpus. The jsLDA code made available by David Mimno is the first javascript implementation of LDA and opens up 
many possibilities for displaying topic models within a Web Browser without the need for server side code. 

This project aims to accomplish the following:
- Extract the LDA code from jsLDA
- Use Twitter Bootstrap for styling
- Allow users to explore a topic by being to view the main words in a topic in context
- Allow users to export select topics

This project is very much a work in progress.
